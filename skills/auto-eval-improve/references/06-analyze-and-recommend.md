# Stage 6 — Compare runs, find weak answers, recommend improvements

Goal: turn the results into actionable recommendations **and act on them**. Compare the current run
against the previous latest run for the same dataset, identify low-accuracy / wrong answers, recommend
concrete fixes — primarily in the **agentic RAG flow** (or the **standard flow** if standard was run), and
*cautiously* in the eval script only when the script itself is wrong — then **execute the top
recommendation and automatically re-run the eval** to measure the effect, iterating up to **3 cycles**
(see 6.7).

## 6.1 Identify current vs previous snapshots

For each dataset, the current snapshot is the newest `$EXP_DIR/<dataset>/<cycle>_<timestamp>/` from
Stage 5; the previous is the next-newest (within the same experiment folder). Example (financebench):

```bash
cd "$SCRIPTS_DIR"
DS=financebench
ls -dt "$EXP_DIR/$DS"/*/ 2>/dev/null   # newest first; [0]=current, [1]=previous
```

If there is **no previous** snapshot (e.g. only the baseline ran so far), analyze the current run on its
own (skip the deltas; do everything else below).

## 6.2 Compare headline metrics

Read both `rag_<dataset>_evaluation_metrics.json` files and diff the means:

```bash
CUR="$EXP_DIR/$DS/<cycle>_<latest_ts>"; PREV="$EXP_DIR/$DS/<cycle>_<prev_ts>"
python3 -m json.tool "$CUR/rag_${DS}_evaluation_metrics.json"
python3 -m json.tool "$PREV/rag_${DS}_evaluation_metrics.json"
```

Compare, per dataset:
- `evaluation_metrics.e2e_accuracy` — primary answer-correctness signal (RAGAS, judged).
- `evaluation_metrics.context_relevance` — how on-topic the retrieved context is.
- `evaluation_metrics.response_groundedness` — how well the answer is supported by context.
- `recall_metrics` (in `..._evaluation_results.json`, page/document level, @1/3/5/10) — retrieval quality.
- `latency` (in `..._evaluation_metrics.json`) — **per-query speed, a co-primary signal alongside accuracy.**
  `total_seconds` is end-to-end (request → last token); `ttft_seconds` is time-to-first-token. Compare
  **`p50_total_seconds`** (robust to outliers) plus `mean_total_seconds`, `p90/p99_total_seconds` (tail), and
  `mean_ttft_seconds`/`p50_ttft_seconds`. Deeper reasoning, verification, and higher top_k all raise latency.
- **Token cost** — a third signal alongside accuracy and latency, via two complementary reports.
  For **total cost**, use the wire **`rag_<dataset>_token_usage.json`** (also surfaced in
  `..._evaluation_metrics.json`'s `token_usage` block): server-authoritative `aggregate.mean_total_tokens`
  with `mean_prompt_tokens` (input — usually the dominant term) and `mean_completion_tokens`, summed across
  every LLM call. For agentic runs the rag-server aggregates the whole request's QueryTrace onto the final
  chunk, so this is now populated (it read `0` on older server builds). Compare `mean_total_tokens` run-to-run
  as the headline cost number. For **where** the cost lives, use **`rag_<dataset>_stream_tokens.json`**:
  compare `aggregate.totals.mean_reasoning_tokens` vs `mean_content_tokens` and read
  `aggregate.by_stage[<stage>].mean_reasoning_tokens` to see **which stage** (`plan`, `execute`,
  `synthesize`, …) the reasoning cost lives in. The stream report is a client-side tiktoken **estimate** of
  streamed **output** text (not exact billing, excludes input), so treat it like latency — good for relative
  comparison within a session. It is the clearest signal for reasoning-config A/Bs: turning a role's
  `ENABLE_THINKING` off should drop that stage's `mean_reasoning_tokens` toward 0; if accuracy holds and the
  wire `mean_total_tokens` drops, that's the cost win quantified. (Both reports skip queries that errored or
  reported no usage — compare them on their shared `sample_count`.)

Report each as **current vs previous (Δ)**, on **both axes — accuracy AND latency**. Flag any regression:
e2e_accuracy down; recall down while latency/tokens up (agentic doing more work for worse answers); or
latency up with no accuracy gain. **Latency-comparison caveat:** the eval runs on a shared LLM endpoint, so
absolute wall-clock drifts run-to-run (worse for cloud endpoints) — prefer p50, lean on within-session /
back-to-back comparisons, and treat sub-±10–15% cross-run latency deltas as noise unless corroborated (e.g.
by shorter answers / fewer reasoning tokens). If `latency.sample_count` ≪ query count or `max_total_seconds`
≈ `--timeout`, requests were timing out — say so rather than trusting the means.

## 6.3 Find the weak / wrong answers

The per-query detail is in `rag_<dataset>_evaluation_data.json` (rows: `question`, `answer` [ground
truth], `generated_answer`, `generated_contexts`, `retrieved_docs`, `usage`); per-query metric scores are
the parallel lists in `rag_<dataset>_evaluation_results.json` (`e2e_accuracy`, `context_relevance`,
`response_groundedness`, `recall_metrics`, `citations`).

For both current and previous runs, surface the worst cases:

```bash
python3 - "$CUR" "$DS" <<'PY'
import json, os, sys
run, ds = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]
data = json.load(open(os.path.join(run, f"rag_{ds}_evaluation_data.json")))
res  = json.load(open(os.path.join(run, f"rag_{ds}_evaluation_results.json")))
acc  = res.get("e2e_accuracy", [])
rel  = res.get("context_relevance", [])
gnd  = res.get("response_groundedness", [])
rows = []
for i, d in enumerate(data):
    rows.append({
        "i": i,
        "e2e": acc[i] if i < len(acc) else None,
        "ctx_rel": rel[i] if i < len(rel) else None,
        "grounded": gnd[i] if i < len(gnd) else None,
        "q": (d.get("question") or "")[:120],
        "gt": (d.get("answer") or "")[:160],
        "gen": (d.get("generated_answer") or "")[:160],
        "n_ctx": len(d.get("generated_contexts") or []),
        "n_docs": len(d.get("retrieved_docs") or []),
    })
worst = sorted(rows, key=lambda r: (r["e2e"] if r["e2e"] is not None else -1))[:15]
for r in worst:
    print(json.dumps(r, ensure_ascii=False))
PY
```

For each low-scoring case, classify the failure (this drives the recommendation):
- **Retrieval miss** — `n_ctx`/`n_docs` empty or the right doc absent, low recall ⇒ retrieval/ingestion problem.
- **Grounding gap** — good context but answer not supported (low groundedness, plausible-but-wrong) ⇒ generation/synthesis problem.
- **Reasoning / multi-hop miss** — context present across docs but the answer fails to combine them ⇒ agentic planning/decomposition problem (or standard RAG lacking multi-hop).
- **Format / judge mismatch** — answer is actually correct but scored low (units, phrasing, refusal, extra prose) ⇒ possible eval/judge issue (treat cautiously, see 6.5).

If a previous snapshot exists, call out **newly-failing** questions (good before, wrong now) and
**newly-fixed** ones — these localize what changed.

## 6.4 Recommend improvements to the RAG flow

> **First read [`06a-recommendation-ideation.md`](06a-recommendation-ideation.md)** — how to analyze the
> results like an agentic-RAG expert, do the homework, and think beyond prompt tweaks (architectural changes
> are in scope). The table below is a **quick-reference starting point, not the limit** of what you may
> recommend.

Map the dominant failure modes to concrete, repo-grounded changes. **Agentic flow** knobs live in
`src/nvidia_rag/utils/agentic_rag_config.py` (env vars surfaced in
`deploy/compose/docker-compose-rag-server.yaml` and Helm `values.yaml`); see
`skills/rag-blueprint/references/configure/agentic-rag.md`.

| Dominant failure | Agentic recommendation | Standard-RAG recommendation |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Retrieval miss / low recall | Raise `--top_k`/`vdb_top_k`; ensure reranking; increase `AGENTIC_PLANNER_MAX_TASKS` / scope rounds so more sub-queries are issued; check chunk_size/overlap at ingestion | Raise `--top_k`/`vdb_top_k`; enable/tune reranker; enable query rewriting; revisit chunking |
| Grounding gap (unsupported answers) | Enable `AGENTIC_VERIFICATION_ENABLED=true` (post-synthesis check + follow-up retrieval); lower synthesis temperature; raise `AGENTIC_CONTEXT_MAX_TOKENS` if context is being truncated | Lower generation temperature; strengthen the system/grounding prompt (`prompt.yaml`); enable citations |
| Multi-hop / reasoning miss | Increase planner task budget / scope rounds; raise `AGENTIC_TASK_ANSWER_MAX_RETRIES`; consider a stronger planner/synthesis model via `AGENTIC_PLANNER_LLM_*` / `AGENTIC_SYNTHESIS_LLM_*` | Enable query decomposition / multi-query; raise top_k; (multi-hop is where agentic typically wins — suggest trying agentic) |
| Timeouts / many `error_count` (also: `latency.max_total_seconds` ≈ `--timeout`, low `latency.sample_count`) | Raise `AGENTIC_LLM_CALL_TIMEOUT` / `AGENTIC_LLM_MAX_RETRIES`; lower `--thread`; lower `AGENTIC_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` | Raise `--timeout`; lower `--thread`; check LLM/vdb capacity |
| High latency / high token cost, marginal accuracy | Reduce per-stage reasoning where it doesn't pay (`AGENTIC_*_LLM_ENABLE_THINKING=false` or `_LOW_EFFORT=true` / a `_REASONING_BUDGET` cap on extraction-style roles); keep verification off for easy datasets; trim `AGENTIC_CONTEXT_MAX_TOKENS`; right-size `top_k` | Lower generation `max_tokens`; trim retrieved context; right-size `top_k` |
| Slow but correct (high `p50/p90_total_seconds`, accuracy fine) | Find the cheapest config that holds accuracy: cap/disable reasoning on roles that don't need it, lower top_k if recall is saturated, disable verification — re-measure latency each step | Lower `max_tokens`; reduce top_k if recall saturated |

Present recommendations ranked by expected impact, each with: the failure evidence (cite specific question
indices **and/or the latency stat**), the exact knob/file to change, and the expected effect.

**Optimize the accuracy↔latency trade-off explicitly, not accuracy alone.** Every candidate change has an
effect on *both* axes — reason about both before recommending:
- **Accuracy-neutral + latency-down ⇒ adopt** (e.g. turning off reasoning on a role that doesn't need it, or
  lowering top_k where recall is already saturated). When two configs tie on accuracy within judge noise,
  **recommend the faster/cheaper one** and say so.
- **Accuracy-up + latency-up ⇒ a trade-off to state plainly** (e.g. enabling verification, deeper reasoning,
  bigger top_k). Quantify both deltas (e.g. "e2e +0.02, p50 latency +35%") and let the user weigh it; don't
  silently buy accuracy with latency.
- **Accuracy-down ⇒ reject** regardless of any latency win (unless the user explicitly wants a speed-first
  config — then surface it as an option, not the default).
- **Reasoning knobs are the main latency lever in the agentic flow.** `enable_thinking` / `reasoning_budget`
  / `low_effort` per role (`AGENTIC_{PLANNER,TASK,SEED_GEN,SYNTHESIS}_LLM_*`) trade reasoning depth for
  speed; the planner/synthesis roles usually need depth, extraction-style roles (task, seed-gen) often don't
  — but **verify per dataset**, since reducing reasoning can quietly cost accuracy on computation-heavy data.

**Code / shared-flow changes must be GENERIC across all datasets — never biased to one dataset.** A change to
rag-server source code (or any prompt / global config) affects *every* query of *every* dataset, not just the
one whose failures motivated it. So before recommending any code change:
- **Gather evidence across the whole experiment.** Check whether the failure mode it targets actually recurs
  across multiple datasets (use the per-dataset + cross-dataset observation tables in `state.md`, seeded in
  Stage 6.3). A pattern seen in only one dataset is a weak basis for a global code change.
- **Assess collateral impact on the OTHER datasets.** Explicitly reason about whether the change could harm
  datasets where those queries currently succeed (e.g. a synthesis-prompt rule tuned for financial line-items
  must not degrade multi-hop answers). If it might, prefer a narrower lever or flag the risk.
- **Justify generically.** Phrase the rationale in terms of the cross-dataset failure mode and the pipeline
  stage it lives in — not "to fix kg_rag #83". Dataset-specific tuning belongs in per-request config/CLI
  levers (e.g. per-dataset `--top_k`), not in shared code.
- Record this reasoning in `state.md` (the *Candidate code-change hypotheses* table) as you go, so the final
  report's code recommendations are backed by recorded cross-dataset evidence.

Env/config and eval-CLI levers can be dataset-scoped (they are applied per run), but the same "show the
evidence" discipline applies. **Prefer the cheapest, most reversible lever first** — order of preference: **(1) env/config knobs → (2) eval-CLI flags → (3) ingestion/index
settings → (4) source-code changes LAST** (rag-server flow code or, cautiously, the eval script).
Source-code changes are a last resort that require **human approval** and an image rebuild — do not rank
one above an unexhausted config lever. Note that some changes require a rag-server restart (route the
actual change through the **`rag-blueprint`** skill). Where useful, propose a focused **A/B re-run** (e.g.
same dataset with verification on, or higher top_k, into a new `--collection` / timestamp) to validate the
hypothesis.

### Recommendation detail standard (applies to EVERY recommendation — config AND code)

Recommendations must be **implementation-ready**: a new agent or engineer who has never seen this run should
be able to apply the change **exactly**, with no further investigation or guesswork. Vague advice ("tune the
prompt", "raise top_k a bit", "improve the planner") is **not acceptable**. Each recommendation must spell out
**all** of the following — be verbose; this is the one place where length is good:

1. **Title & summary** — one line naming the change and the failure it fixes.
2. **Evidence** — the failure mode, the datasets it affects, and **specific question indices + the wrong vs
   correct values / metric deltas** that motivate it (pull the real values from the result JSONs).
3. **Exact location** — for config: the **env var name**, the **exact file(s)** (`deploy/compose/.env`,
   `nvdev.env`, Helm `values.yaml`) and the line. For code: **`path/to/file.py` → function/constant name →
   line range**.
4. **The exact change — full text, not a paraphrase.**
   - Config/env: `VAR: current_value → new_value` (real current value read from the running container / env
     file).
   - Code or prompt text: show the **complete current snippet** and the **complete proposed replacement**
     (a full before/after block or unified `diff`). For prompt edits, write the **actual new prompt wording
     verbatim** — the exact sentence(s) to insert and where (which numbered rule / which section), not a
     description of what to say. The reader must be able to copy it in directly.
5. **Mechanism — why it works** — how the change addresses the failure at that pipeline stage.
6. **Expected effect (both axes)** — which **accuracy** metric moves and rough magnitude, **which specific
   failing indices should flip to correct**, AND the expected **latency** effect (p50/TTFT up, down, or
   neutral, rough magnitude) — so the re-run can be checked against a concrete prediction on both axes. If
   the change is a deliberate trade-off (accuracy up, latency up — or the reverse), state the trade explicitly.
7. **How to apply** — the concrete steps/commands, including whether it needs a **restart**, an **image
   rebuild** (`docker compose build`), or **re-ingestion**, and which file is the source of truth.
8. **How to verify** — what to check after applying: health curl, a probe `/generate` request if useful, and
   the targeted re-run + the indices to re-inspect.
9. **Cross-dataset impact** — per the cross-dataset rule above (required for code/shared changes).
10. **Rollback** — the exact reverse step (old value / revert the diff) so the change is safely undoable.

Apply this standard in the in-chat summary (6.6), the final report (6.8, especially D.1/D.2), and any
`report.md`. Config recommendations get the same fields as code ones — only the "exact change" format differs.

## 6.5 Cautiously recommend eval-script changes (only if warranted)

Only suggest changing `evaluate_rag.py` / `rag_evaluator/` when the **evaluation itself is wrong**, not to
inflate scores. Legitimate cases: correct answers consistently judged wrong due to formatting/units; the
judge model unavailable or mis-specified; recall computed against a missing/ill-formed `train_extended.json`;
a parsing bug dropping valid responses. For each, point to the specific code (e.g. the citation/judge
prompt, the recall `granularity` logic, the `error_count` handling) and describe a **minimal, reviewable**
change — flag it clearly as an *eval methodology* change so metric comparisons across runs stay honest.
Never silently alter scoring to make a flow look better.

## Writing style for ALL reports (6.6 and 6.8) — plain, simple language

Reports are read by people who may not know the internals. Write so a non-expert can follow it. This applies
to the in-chat summary **and** the persisted `report.md`.

**Make the report self-contained and generic — assume the reader knows only the `rag/` repo, not this skill,
the task prompt, or the run history.** A reviewer should understand the report on its own, even if it is
published or shared outside this session:
- **Never use internal labels or shorthand** that only make sense from the task prompt or skill (e.g. "rule
  5a", "cycle 2", "the change under test", "as requested", "per the run config"). If a change is being
  evaluated, **describe what it actually does and where it lives in the `rag/` repo** (the file/prompt/knob
  and its effect in plain terms) — not the nickname it was given in the request.
- **State the subject up front:** what was changed, which file/setting it touches, and what it was supposed
  to improve — so the rest of the report stands on its own.
- **Don't reference the conversation or the skill's stages/mechanics** ("Stage 6", "the skip check", "the
  experiment folder convention"). Refer only to artifacts by their on-disk paths.
- Spell out dataset names and what each tests; don't assume the reader knows the benchmark suite.
- Write as a standalone engineering report about the RAG pipeline, not as a reply to whoever launched the run.

- **Lead with a "Short answer" / bottom line** in 2–4 plain sentences: did the change help, yes/no, and why.
  Put it before any tables or detail.
- **Short, direct sentences.** Prefer everyday words over jargon. Avoid words like "leverage", "upstream",
  "orthogonal", "disposition". If a term like *synthesis*, *planner*, or *recall* is unavoidable, add a
  one-line plain-English gloss the first time (e.g. "recall — did the right source document show up?").
- **Explain the metrics once, simply** (a short "what the numbers mean" list): e2e_accuracy = is the answer
  correct; context_relevance = was retrieved text on-topic; groundedness = is the answer backed by the text;
  recall@k = did the right doc/page appear in the top k (these four are 0–1, higher is better); **latency =
  how long a query took — total seconds end-to-end and TTFT (time to first token), reported as p50 (typical)
  and p90/p99 (worst case); lower is better.** Add the one-line caveat that latency is measured on a shared
  endpoint so small run-to-run differences are noise.
- **Use plain headers** ("Short answer", "What we tested", "Results", "What's still wrong",
  "Recommendations") and small tables instead of dense paragraphs.
- **Describe failures concretely**, not abstractly: show *what was asked*, *the correct answer*, *what the
  model said*, and *why it's wrong* in one line — ideally as a table row.
- **Recommendations as a short numbered list**, each one sentence of plain "do X to fix Y", ordered by
  expected impact. Keep the exact knob/file/diff details, but phrase the headline plainly.
- Keep it grounded: still cite real numbers and question indices, but in service of clarity, not to show off
  rigor. **Simple and correct beats thorough and impenetrable.**

## 6.6 Deliver the summary

Write it in the plain language described above. Produce a report containing:
1. Per-dataset metric table: current vs previous (Δ), **including latency (p50 total + mean/p50 TTFT) and
   token cost (wire `mean_total_tokens` from `rag_<dataset>_token_usage.json` for the headline cost, plus mean
   reasoning tokens for agentic from `rag_<dataset>_stream_tokens.json`)
   alongside the accuracy metrics**, with regressions on *either* axis flagged. For reasoning-config A/Bs,
   show the per-stage reasoning-token change so the cost saving (or rise) is explicit.
2. Top failing questions with failure classification and short evidence (note any "slow but correct" cases
   from the latency tail if relevant).
3. Ranked recommendations (flow first; eval-script only if justified). **Each recommendation must follow the
   full *Recommendation detail standard* (§6.4) — implementation-ready, with exact location, the complete
   verbatim change, apply + verify steps, expected effect, and rollback.** Plain language and *detailed* are
   not in tension: keep the wording simple, but include every concrete detail a reader needs to apply it
   exactly. Do **not** abbreviate recommendations to a one-liner.
4. Suggested next experiment (the A/B re-run) if a recommendation is speculative.

Keep it grounded in the actual result files and cite question indices / metric numbers so the user can verify.

## 6.7 Execute the top recommendation and re-run (auto-iterate, max 3 cycles)

Recommendations are **not** the end state — **act on them**. After delivering the 6.6 summary, the skill
must apply the single highest-impact flow/config recommendation and **automatically run the next eval** to
measure its effect, closing the loop: recommend → execute → re-run → re-compare.

Each cycle:
1. **Apply the change.** Route any rag-server config/env change through the **`rag-blueprint`** skill —
   edit the active env file, recreate only rag-server while keeping existing env intact, verify health.
   See `skills/rag-blueprint/references/deploy/docker.md` → *"Update Env Vars on a Running Deployment"*.
   Apply **one** change (or one tightly-coupled group) per cycle so the effect is attributable.

   **What the change requires before re-running** — pick the row, do only that:

   | Change type | Recreate rag-server? | Re-ingest? | Re-run as |
   |-------------|----------------------|------------|-----------|
   | Server env/config (`AGENTIC_*`, `ENABLE_AGENTIC_RAG`) | **Yes** (env-intact) | No | `--skip_ingestion` |
   | Eval-CLI flag only (`--top_k`, `--thread`, `--model`, `--llm_endpoint`, `--agentic`) | No | No | `--skip_ingestion` (just re-run the script) |
   | Ingestion/index (`chunk_size`, `chunk_overlap`, embedding model) | No | **Yes** (`--force_ingestion`) | `--force_ingestion` |
   | rag-server **source code** (`src/nvidia_rag/**`) — *human-review only, NOT auto-looped* | `prompt.yaml`: restart (live-mounted). Other `.py`: **rebuild image** (`docker compose build`) + recreate | No | `--skip_ingestion` |
   | Eval-script code (6.5) — *human-review only, NOT auto-looped* | No | No | `--skip_ingestion` (flag as eval-methodology) |

2. **Re-run the eval** (Stage 4) into a new timestamped snapshot (Stage 5), using the row above. The
   snapshot must include a self-contained **`REPRODUCE.md`** (Stage 5.4) capturing this cycle's exact
   apply-change commands + the verbatim `evaluate_rag.py` command + resulting metrics.
3. **Re-compare** (6.2–6.3) against the immediately-preceding snapshot; report the Δ and whether the
   specific failure indices the change targeted actually improved.

**Hard cap: at most 3 improve cycles.** The primary metric is **e2e_accuracy**; stop earlier if a cycle
**regresses** it or **plateaus** (no meaningful gain). Latency is a **secondary** objective: a cycle that is
accuracy-neutral but cuts latency is still a *win* worth keeping, and a latency-only optimization cycle is
legitimate once accuracy has plateaued — but **never accept an accuracy regression to win latency** (unless
the user explicitly asked for a speed-first config). When the cap is reached — or on accuracy
regression/plateau — stop, summarize the **trajectory across all cycles on both axes** (accuracy + p50/TTFT
latency, snapshot-by-snapshot), and hand back to the user for direction. Never loop indefinitely or stack
many untested changes at once.

**Code changes are the last priority.** Exhaust every env/config and eval-CLI lever (6.4) across
the cycle budget *first*; only consider a source-code change when config tuning cannot address the failure
mode. **Source-code changes are excluded from this auto-loop and require explicit human approval** — never
auto-apply them. The loop applies only env/config and eval-CLI changes.

- **rag-server flow code** (`src/nvidia_rag/**.py`) — high blast radius (affects every query), requires an
  **image rebuild**, not trivially reversible. Do **not** edit during the loop; record it as a proposal in
  **6.8 step 4** and apply only after the user approves. (`prompt.yaml` is live-mounted and takes effect on
  a restart — still treat it as a reviewed flow change, after config levers.)
- **eval-script code** (`evaluate_rag.py` / `rag_evaluator/`, 6.5) — alters the *measurement*, so before/
  after runs are not apples-to-apples. Propose for human review; flag as *eval-methodology*.

If the user approves a code change, treat the next run as a **new baseline**, not a continuation of the
env-tuning trajectory.

## 6.8 Final report after 3 cycles — consolidated change report

Once the loop ends for **every** dataset (cap reached, plateau, or regression on each), produce one
**clear, plain-language report** a reviewer can act on without re-reading the run history — follow the
*"Writing style for ALL reports"* rules above (lead with a Short answer, simple words, glossed terms, small
tables). Detailed and professional does **not** mean dense or jargon-heavy: a non-expert should be able to
read the executive summary and per-dataset verdicts and understand what happened and what to do. **Persist
it to `$EXP_DIR/report.md`** (replaces the old ad-hoc `AUTO_EVAL_REPORT.md` at the scripts root) as well as
delivering it in chat, so the experiment folder is self-contained. Be thorough: describe **every cycle of
every dataset**, give an **overall verdict**, and end with the **overall recommended changes** (env and/or
code). Keep it grounded — every claim cites metric deltas and/or specific question indices from the
snapshots. Cover all cycles and datasets with **no silent omissions**. Use this structure:

### A. Executive summary (cross-dataset)
3–5 sentences: datasets evaluated, cycles run on each, the best configuration found, net movement vs
baseline per dataset **on both accuracy and latency**, and the single headline conclusion (state whether any
config was a free latency win or an accuracy↔latency trade-off).

### B. Per-dataset detail — repeat this whole block for EACH dataset

**B.1 Overview** — baseline vs best metrics (e2e_accuracy, context_relevance, response_groundedness,
recall@1/5, **and latency: p50 total + mean/p50 TTFT**) and the dominant failure mode(s) identified in 6.3.

**B.2 Run trajectory** — one row per snapshot, oldest→newest (accuracy **and** latency columns):

| Cycle | Snapshot | Change applied | e2e | ctx_rel | grounded | recall@1 | p50_lat_s | ttft_s | Verdict |
|-------|----------|----------------|-----|---------|----------|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| base  | `<ts>`   | —              | …   | …       | …        | …        | …         | …      | baseline |
| 1     | `<ts>`   | `<change>`     | …   | …       | …        | …        | …         | …      | gain / plateau / regress / faster-same-acc / trade-off |

**B.3 Per-cycle description** — for EACH cycle, a short paragraph (not just the table row):
- **Hypothesis** — the failure mode (or latency cost) targeted and why (cite question indices / metrics).
- **Change applied** — exact env/config knob old→new and how it was applied.
- **Effect (both axes)** — accuracy Δ (how many queries improved vs regressed, whether the *targeted*
  indices moved) **and latency Δ (p50/TTFT)**; if it's a trade-off, state it.
- **Command & repro** — the exact `evaluate_rag.py` invocation used for the cycle (verbatim), plus a link
  to the snapshot's reproduction doc `$EXP_DIR/<dataset>/<cycle>_<ts>/REPRODUCE.md` (full apply+run steps, Stage 5.4).
- **Verdict & decision** — gain / plateau / regression, and what was decided (keep, revert, try next lever).

**B.4 Dataset verdict** — best config for this dataset (the accuracy/latency winner — note when the choice
is a speed-vs-quality trade-off), keep-or-revert per cycle change, and the residual failure modes that
config could not fix.

### C. Overall verdict (cross-dataset)
Synthesize across datasets: which levers helped consistently, which were dataset-specific, which were
net-neutral / within judge noise. **Report on both axes — accuracy and latency** — e.g. which levers cut
latency without hurting accuracy (free wins), which bought accuracy at a latency cost (trade-offs), and
which were neutral on both. State the overall best-known configuration, and (if different) the best
**latency-optimized** configuration that holds accuracy.

### D. Overall recommended changes
The actionable bottom line, in two clearly separated subsections:

**D.1 Env-var changes** — config to **adopt** (validated improvement on accuracy and/or latency) or
**revert / do not adopt** (regressed, or net-neutral with added latency/cost). Evidence must cover **both
axes**:

| Env var | Current | Recommended | Scope (Docker / Helm) | Evidence — accuracy (dataset, Δ, indices) | Evidence — latency (p50/TTFT Δ) | Status |
|---------|---------|-------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|--------|
| `AGENTIC_VERIFICATION_ENABLED` | `false` | `true` | `.env` / `values.yaml` | kg_rag: fixed N refusals (#…), e2e Δ … | p50 +…s (verification adds a pass) | Adopt / Revert |
| `AGENTIC_SEED_GEN_LLM_ENABLE_THINKING` | `true` | `false` | `.env` / `values.yaml` | accuracy-neutral (within noise) | p50 −…s / fewer tokens | Adopt / Revert |

For each: source of truth (`deploy/compose/.env` or `nvdev.env`; Helm `values.yaml`); applying follows
`skills/rag-blueprint/references/deploy/docker.md` → *"Update Env Vars on a Running Deployment"*
(env-intact recreate + curl verification).

**D.2 Code changes (last resort — human approval required)** — include **only** when env/config and
eval-CLI levers were exhausted and could not address the failure mode; **omit and say so if none**.

**Code changes MUST be generic and valid across all datasets in the experiment — never biased to one
dataset.** Source-code / prompt / shared-config changes affect every query of every dataset, so each one must
be justified by cross-dataset evidence and must not silently regress datasets that currently pass. A change
motivated by a single dataset's failures, with no evidence it generalizes (and no check that it won't hurt
the others), is **not** an acceptable code recommendation — downgrade it to a dataset-scoped config/CLI lever
or move it to **E. Not-yet-tested ideas** with the caveat noted.

Each entry must be **self-contained and independently applicable** and follow the full *Recommendation detail
standard* (§6.4) — exact code, mechanism, expected effect with target indices, apply + verify steps, and
rollback, not just a diff. For **prompt-text** changes, include the **complete current text** of the affected
rule/section and the **complete proposed replacement text verbatim** (so it can be pasted in directly), in
addition to the diff. Required fields:

- **Location** — `path/to/file.py` : function / constant / line range.
- **Exact diff**:
  ```diff
  # src/nvidia_rag/rag_server/agentic_rag/<file>.py  (fn: <name>)
  - <current line>
  + <changed line>
  ```
- **Rationale (generic)** — describe the **cross-dataset failure mode** and pipeline stage it fixes, not a
  single dataset's question. Reference the *Cross-dataset failure-mode rollup* in `state.md`.
- **Cross-dataset impact (REQUIRED)** — a small table over **every** dataset in the experiment: for each,
  state expected effect (helps / neutral / risk) and the evidence (failing indices it should fix, or
  currently-passing cases it must not break). A change with no cross-dataset support, or a likely regression
  on any dataset, must NOT be recommended as a code change.

  | Dataset | Expected effect | Evidence (indices / metric) |
  |---------|-----------------|-----------------------------|
- **Type** — `flow` (rag-server) or **`eval-methodology`** (`evaluate_rag.py` / `rag_evaluator/`, per 6.5).
- **Apply cost** — restart vs **image rebuild** (`docker compose build`); `prompt.yaml` = restart only.
- **Risk & blast radius** — low/med/high; what else it could affect (recall this hits all datasets).
- **Independence** — ordering dependency, or "independent".

Rank code changes strictly **below** every env/config item; none applied without user sign-off; each
re-validated against a fresh baseline **across the full dataset set** after approval (a code change validated
on only one dataset is not considered validated).

Every adopted/tested change links to its cycle's `$EXP_DIR/<dataset>/<cycle>_<ts>/REPRODUCE.md` (Stage 5.4)
so a reviewer can re-run any cycle exactly, step by step.

### E. Not-yet-tested ideas
Ranked backlog of levers the 3-cycle budget did not reach (per dataset or shared), each with the target
failure cluster and expected impact, so work can resume later.

Rules: recommend — never silently apply code changes; never inflate scores; cite real snapshot numbers so
every claim is verifiable; cover every cycle and dataset with no silent omissions; **code/shared-flow
recommendations must be generic and evidence-backed across all datasets in the experiment, never biased to a
single dataset** (dataset-specific tuning → config/CLI levers, not code).
